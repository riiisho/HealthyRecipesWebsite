<h1>Web Design Project - Healthy Recipes Website</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project consists of hosting, designing and building a website for an established supermarket to promote healthy recipes for their customers. The idea is to build a website following the client requirements whilst utilising tools such as HTML, CSS, and PHP for dynamic web pages. The website should also be responsive so that it can be opened on mobile.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

The initial website design must have 5 pages. Two of the pages must be a landing page to encourage users to sign up and a contact page which has a map showing the location of their offices with a form that allows a user to contact the company. This page could also link to terms of use and the privacy policy.  The remaining 3 pages should showcase recipes with images, ingredients and the method. You could also provide nutritional information. These pages could be a dynamic page with data fed from a database or static pages. You could also allow users to comment on the recipes but they would need to be authenticated first through a log-in page. You will need to design this log-in page even if you do not implement this feature.
